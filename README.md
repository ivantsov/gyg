# GYG

## The task

Create a web app that visualises what a random GetYourGuide customer is doing right now.

Guidelines:

* The app should update the information automatically, no user interactions are necessary.
* We recommend using npm http-server for an environment.  Optimally the app can be started using a single command (e.g. gulp, grunt) after installing dependencies.
* For simplicity sake, no branding guidelines need to be met. Full creative freedom!
* The app does not need to be optimised for mobile devices.
* The final deliverable will be a ZIP file containing the app code

## Solution

First of all, you can find the working app here: https://ivantsov.github.io/gyg

It should perfectly work on **all modern browsers with support of ES6**.

### How to run

If you want to run the app locally: `npm i && npm run build`.

After that, please open `index.html` file in the browser.
